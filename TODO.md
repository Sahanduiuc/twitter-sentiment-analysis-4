## on CNN

1. current CNN flattens out around 85%. Make the model bigger, add more layers, see swisscheese
2. Validation accuracy same as accuracy here, so validate on 5-10%
3. Glove embedding + word2vec embeddings separate channels of input. Current embedding is being learned.

## on LSTM
1. Get it running

## on OpenAI sentiment neuron
1. Get features + classifier

## Make ensemble
2. see how swisscheese makes classifier

## Literally everything

1. Code structure with CV in keras (tf backend) and add logistic regression
2. Vocbulary creation + document encoding (in diff formats) 
3. Train 
  + GloVe 
  + Word2vec (use pretrained in beginning) 
  + LDA topic modelling
3. Set up Azure
4. Write an RNN/LSTM architecture 
5. Read Other code, literature <- All

. End model will be an ensemble anyway (or NN)
