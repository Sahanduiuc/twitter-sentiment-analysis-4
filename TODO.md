## Literally everything

1. Code structure with CV in keras (tf backend) and add logistic regression
2. Train 
  + GloVe 
  + Word2vec (use pretrained in beginning) 
  + LDA topic modelling
3. Set up Azure
4. Write an RNN/LSTM architecture 
5. Read Other code, literature <- All

. End model will be an ensemble anyway (or NN)
