## Literally everything

1. Code structure with CV in keras (tf backend) and add logistic regression
2. Train 
..*GloVe 
..*Word2vec (use pretrained in beginning) 
..*LDA topic modeling 
3. Write an RNN/LSTM architecture 
4. Read Other code, literature <- All

. End model will be an ensemble anyway (or NN)
